# Team Blog

## Week 1 
This week we formed our team, created our team contract and established communication methods through a Discord server and a Facebook group chat. We had our first meeting on Monday evening to work on the game proposal and prior to the meeting we made sure that each team member came with 2-3 rough ideas for the game so that we could all brainstorm and discuss. Details about the meeting were also jotted down. The game proposal document was then polished and submitted, and then we prepared our presentation for the lecture.<br>

## Week 2 
Following the greenlight presentation during lecture, we noted down the critiques that we recieved and then had a very brief meeting on Monday evening to discuss them while refining specific points such as the camera angle and movement. Movement seemed to be something that we haven't narrowed down entirely yet, so we have agreed to brainstorm 2 - 3 ways of movement that we would like to implement for our next meeting, where we will also address any critiques that have been given on canvas from the game proposal submission.<br>
