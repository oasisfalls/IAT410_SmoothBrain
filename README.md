# Team Blog

## Week 1 
This week we formed our team, created our team contract and established communication methods through a Discord server and a Facebook group chat. We had our first meeting on Monday evening to work on the game proposal and prior to the meeting we made sure that each team member came with 2-3 rough ideas for the game so that we could all brainstorm and discuss. Details about the meeting were also jotted down. The game proposal document was then polished and submitted, and then we prepared our presentation for the lecture.
