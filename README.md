# Team Blog

## Week 3
Our team had two meetings this week, one on Monday to discuss and complete our first version of the GDD, and then one on Tuesday to create our presentation. During our Monday meeting our team discussed and agreed upon how our movement mechanics would work, which is using the mouse and right clicking to briefly stop time to allow the player to choose a direction to go in for their smooth brain. A rough idea of this concept is shown below.

Majority of the GDD was quite straight forward from our proposal but we decided to create very rough ideas of what our gameplay would look like including the home and game over screen so that we had more visuals for ourself and also for our presentation. After our GDD was completed we worked on the slides for our presentation in figma and then created a script. The idea of basing the levels off of parts of the brain was brought up in the meeting and so far we all like the idea but have not gone into details about how the levels would be crafted yet or how they would exactly look. The artwork for the characters and a potential power up was created as well.

## Week 2 
Following the greenlight presentation during lecture, we noted down the critiques that we recieved and then had a very brief meeting on Monday evening to discuss them while refining specific points such as the camera angle and movement. Movement seemed to be something that we haven't narrowed down entirely yet, so we have agreed to brainstorm 2 - 3 ways of movement that we would like to implement for our next meeting, where we will also address any critiques that have been given on canvas from the game proposal submission.<br>

## Week 1 
This week we formed our team, created our team contract and established communication methods through a Discord server and a Facebook group chat. We had our first meeting on Monday evening to work on the game proposal and prior to the meeting we made sure that each team member came with 2-3 rough ideas for the game so that we could all brainstorm and discuss. Details about the meeting were also jotted down. The game proposal document was then polished and submitted, and then we prepared our presentation for the lecture.<br>
