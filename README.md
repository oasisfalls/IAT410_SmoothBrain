## Week 6

With more time to work on our next prototype, our team got together on Sunday evening to discuss feedback that we recieved from our classmates, TA, and prof during our lab, how we want to implement that, and other changes we would like to have done for the next prototype as well. We made quite a long list and noted some points that would be a much lower priority than others such as the story to incorporate into our tutorial level as we aim to have animations for that, but the mechanics are the main focus that we want to complete these coming weeks. We assigned roles for every member, Caleb will handle sprites, creating soft block tiles and an angry state for the skateboard enemy sprite, Louis will handle general coding, Radu will work on more level design and refining our current levels in Unity, and Aneeta will handle the supplementary documents going towards the next hand-in such as the GDD and setting up Playtesting templates. We will be refining what we want done and what tasks each team members will be doing/assisting others with when we have a check-in meeting on Friday.

## Week 5

This week we ended up having three meetings. During our first meeting on Friday evening we discussed initial thoughts on our prototype to prepare for playtesting sessions, and then decided on what to change/add to be ready for our playtesting session. Since we could not progress further with an updated GDD, we had our second meeting on Sunday evening to finalize the prototype and decided how many playable levels we'd incorporate since we had hand drawn many level designs. 

We had our final meeting on Tuesday in two sessions. First was to brush up the prototype such as adding the ability to reset back to level 1 once the player dies and so that when the player is at a low enough speed and isn't near a all, it will be able to launch itself again at the cost of health. One of our team members then ran the playtesting sessions, and then we regrouped to discuss the outcomes and completed the GDD along with the Playtesting sheet. We have some updated sprites to add this week as well such as two enemy types to differentiate it from the main player, and the walls.

## Week 4

We had nothing necessarily due this week, but to prepare for the upcoming playtesting our group had a meeting on Monday evening to really solidify the mechanics of our game after the critique that we got in the previous lab. We had assigned specific things for each teammate to do and aimed to have our prototype done by Thursday. 

Some details that we figured out were that each time our brain character kicks off of a wall it was increase their momentum, which will be calculated by vector equations. Friction is always at play, and we incorporated ways to restore health during levels such as using the idea of having it in a hard to reach corner or area of the room where it will only spawn at a certain time. We are not sure if we want this game to be realtime yet although we are leaning towards it, but ultimately we will decide after playtesting. 

Otherwise, the prototype has begun, team members are learning to code and learn the engine to assist our head developer, and the artwork and level design is slowly progressing as well.

## Week 3
Our team had two meetings this week, one on Monday to discuss and complete our first version of the GDD, and then one on Tuesday to create our presentation. During our Monday meeting our team discussed and agreed upon how our movement mechanics would work, which is using the mouse and right clicking to briefly stop time to allow the player to choose a direction to go in for their smooth brain. A rough idea of this concept is shown below.

Majority of the GDD was quite straight forward from our proposal but we decided to create very rough ideas of what our gameplay would look like including the home and game over screen so that we had more visuals for ourself and also for our presentation. After our GDD was completed we worked on the slides for our presentation in figma and then created a script. The idea of basing the levels off of parts of the brain was brought up in the meeting and so far we all like the idea but have not gone into details about how the levels would be crafted yet or how they would exactly look. The artwork for the characters and a potential power up was created as well.

## Week 2 
Following the greenlight presentation during lecture, we noted down the critiques that we recieved and then had a very brief meeting on Monday evening to discuss them while refining specific points such as the camera angle and movement. Movement seemed to be something that we haven't narrowed down entirely yet, so we have agreed to brainstorm 2 - 3 ways of movement that we would like to implement for our next meeting, where we will also address any critiques that have been given on canvas from the game proposal submission.<br>

## Week 1 
This week we formed our team, created our team contract and established communication methods through a Discord server and a Facebook group chat. We had our first meeting on Monday evening to work on the game proposal and prior to the meeting we made sure that each team member came with 2-3 rough ideas for the game so that we could all brainstorm and discuss. Details about the meeting were also jotted down. The game proposal document was then polished and submitted, and then we prepared our presentation for the lecture.<br>
